# CD74AC174 Hex D-Flip-Flop

This module implements a **6-bit D-Flip-Flop**, based on the architecture of a **CD74AC174** integrated circuit.

This module came after moduling a D-Flip-Flop and was design to building a more complex, real-world component. It demonstrates:
- **Hierarchical design** by instantiating six individual DFF modules.
- The handling of common IC features like an active-low clear input.

The included testbench provides stimulus, including random data and clear pulses, to thoroughly simulate the module's behavior.
