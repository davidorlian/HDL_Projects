# D-Flip-Flop

This module focuses on the **D-Flip-Flop (DFF)**, recognizing its crucial role as the basic memory element in all digital **registers**.

It represents for me the **beginning of the path** to understanding and potentially modeling the intricate architecture of **Timer2** module of the **Analog Devices ADuC841** microcontroller.
